## Why Research Content Matters

### 1. EEAT Amplification
Google's quality raters specifically look for:
- **Citations to authoritative sources** (PubMed, medical journals)
- **Expert validation** (doctor quotes, researcher references)
- **Transparent methodology** (how you arrived at claims)

A research page transforms you from "spa making health claims" to "evidence-based wellness center."

### 2. LLM Retrieval Priority
When AI assistants answer questions like:
- "What are the benefits of cold plunge?"
- "Is HBOT safe?"
- "Does sauna help with inflammation?"

They prioritize sources that:
- Cite peer-reviewed research
- Include specific study data (percentages, sample sizes)
- Quote recognized experts
- Present balanced, educational content

**Your research pages become the source LLMs pull from.**

### 3. SEO Keyword Capture
Research pages rank for high-intent informational queries:

| Query Type | Example | Intent |
|------------|---------|--------|
| "Benefits of..." | "benefits of cold plunge therapy" | Research phase |
| "Studies on..." | "sauna studies heart health" | Validation phase |
| "Is X safe..." | "is HBOT safe" | Consideration phase |
| "X vs Y..." | "infrared vs traditional sauna" | Comparison phase |

These visitors are actively researching before purchasing—highest quality traffic.

### 4. Conversion Support
Skeptical high-ticket buyers ($4,000 HBOT sessions) need evidence. A research page answers:
- "Is this real or wellness woo?"
- "What does the actual science say?"
- "Who else uses this?"

## Content Architecture

### Recommended Page Structure

```
/research (Hub Page)
├── /research/sauna-benefits
├── /research/cold-plunge-science
├── /research/hbot-therapy
├── /research/red-light-therapy
└── /research/contrast-therapy
```

### Alternative: Single Comprehensive Page
If resources are limited, create one `/science` or `/research` page with sections for each therapy. This still captures the SEO and trust benefits.
